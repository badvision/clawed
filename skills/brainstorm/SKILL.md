# Brainstorm

**⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: This is an alias for `/socratize`. You MUST IMMEDIATELY invoke the `/socratize` slash command. DO NOT attempt to do any work yourself. Your ONLY job is to invoke `/socratize` right away.

## Immediate Action Required

Use the Skill tool to invoke `/socratize`:

```
Skill(
  skill: "socratize"
)
```

The `/socratize` command will orchestrate the Socratic dialogue process for multi-agent consensus building.

## Overview

The `/brainstorm` command is an alias for `/socratize`, which orchestrates a Socratic dialogue process with multiple analyst and architect agents, each with unique personalities and perspectives, to thoroughly analyze complex software problems and build consensus on solutions.

For complete documentation, see the socratize skill.

## Example Usage

```
User: "We need to add rate limiting to the API endpoints"
/brainstorm

→ This will invoke /socratize, which will:
1. Deploy technical-analyst to clarify problem/context/outcome
2. Determine scope and agent counts
3. Deploy analysts and architects with diverse personalities
4. Manage Socratic dialogue until consensus
```

## When to Use

Use `/brainstorm` (same as `/socratize`) when you need:
- Multiple perspectives on architectural decisions
- Consensus-building for complex features
- Thorough analysis before making system-wide changes
- Deep research leveraging issue tracker, documentation, and codebase
